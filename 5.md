### üîç Visual Studio Run Options for ASP.NET Core MVC: Explained Clearly

When you're developing an ASP.NET Core MVC project in **Visual Studio**, you‚Äôll see several run/debug options like:

- **Hot Reload**
- **Start Without Debugging**
- **IIS Express / Project (HTTP/HTTPS) / WSL**

Here's what each one means and **when to use it**:

---

## üöÄ 1. Hot Reload

**What it is:**
Hot Reload updates your app in real-time without restarting the app or losing your current state.

**Use when:**

- You're making **UI or minor logic changes**.
- You want to save time by **not restarting** the application for every change.

**Limitations:**

- Some changes (e.g., startup configs, routing changes) still require a full rebuild.

---

## üêû 2. Start Without Debugging (Ctrl + F5)

**What it is:**
Runs the application **without attaching the debugger**.

**Use when:**

- You want to **quickly test performance** or behavior.
- You're **not debugging** but just verifying output.

**Advantages:**

- **Faster startup** than running with debugger.
- Avoids debugger overhead.

**Disadvantages:**

- You can't set breakpoints or inspect variables.

## üåê 3. IIS Express / HTTP / HTTPS / WSL ‚Äî What are these?

These are the **server environments** or **profiles** you can choose to run your app under.

---

### ‚úÖ IIS Express (default)

**What it is:**
A lightweight, local version of IIS (Internet Information Services) that runs directly from Visual Studio.

**Use when:**

- You want to test your app **in a simulated IIS environment**.
- You're using **Windows** and want to simulate production hosting.

**Pros:**

- Easy setup, supports SSL (HTTPS).
- Works well with Hot Reload.

---

### üåê Project (HTTP/HTTPS)

**What it is:**
Runs your app using **Kestrel**, the built-in cross-platform web server.

**Use when:**

- You want to test the app **outside of IIS Express**.
- You're preparing for **deployment scenarios** (e.g., Linux hosting, Docker).

**Pros:**

- Matches how your app will behave in real-world hosting.
- Good for **Docker, cloud, or Linux**-based development.

---

### üêß WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

**What it is:**
Runs your ASP.NET Core app inside a **Linux environment on Windows**.

**Use when:**

- You‚Äôre building apps that target **Linux environments**.
- You want to **test cross-platform compatibility**.

**Requires:**

- WSL installed and configured.
- ASP.NET Core runtime installed in the Linux distro.

| **Start Without Debug**  | Run app without debugging tools        | Speed tests, checking app without breakpoints |
| **IIS Express**          | Local IIS-like environment             | Default dev, Windows-based testing            |
| **Project (HTTP/HTTPS)** | Runs with Kestrel (real hosting style) | When targeting real-world production / Docker |
| **WSL**                  | Linux-based hosting inside Windows     | Linux compatibility, Docker, cloud-ready dev  |
