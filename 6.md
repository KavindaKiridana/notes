Great! You're working on a real-world ASP.NET Core MVC app and now it's time to **learn how to debug using breakpoints** in Visual Studio — a must-have skill for every developer. Let's break it down in a beginner-friendly and **structured** way while using your current **"wrong societies in datalist" bug** as a real example to learn from.

---

## 🧠 1. **What is a Breakpoint in Visual Studio?**

A **breakpoint** is a marker that tells Visual Studio:
➡️ "**Pause the program here when running**".

It lets you examine:

- Variable values (`CCode`, `societies`, etc.)
- Flow of logic (does it go inside the right `if` blocks?)
- SQL results and object data

---

## 🧰 2. **Types of Breakpoints (You Mentioned)**

| Type                   | Shortcut            | What it Does                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insert Breakpoint      | F9                  | Normal pause at that line                                            |
| Conditional Breakpoint | Right-click > Cond. | Pause **only if a condition is true** (e.g. `CCode == 2`)            |
| Tracepoint             | Shift + Alt + F9, T | Like a breakpoint, but just **prints a message** instead of stopping |
| Temporary Breakpoint   | Shift + Alt + F9, T | Breaks only **once**                                                 |
| Dependent Breakpoint   | Shift + Alt + F9, D | Runs **only after another breakpoint is hit**                        |

## 🛠️ 3. **Step-by-Step Debugging for Your Problem**

We’ll now debug why **extra societies not belonging to `CCode=2` are showing up**.

### ✅ STEP 1: Set a Regular Breakpoint on the Line That Loads Societies

In your controller:

```csharp
string sqlSocieties = "SELECT ID, SocietyName, SocietyCode FROM tblDSociety WHERE CCode = @CCode and Status=1 ORDER BY SocietyCode ASC";
```

👉 **Click the left margin next to this line** or **press F9** to insert a **regular breakpoint**.

---

### ✅ STEP 2: Start Debugging

1. Run your app in **Debug Mode**: Press `F5`
2. Navigate to the form page in your browser
3. Visual Studio will **pause (break)** when it reaches the breakpoint

---

### ✅ STEP 3: Watch the Value of `CCode`

1. Hover your mouse over `CCode`:

   - ❗ Is it really `2`?

2. If not, your bug might be:

   - `HttpContext.Session.GetInt32("CCode")` is not storing the correct value
   - The session is null or overridden

👁️ You can also add `CCode` to the **Watch Window**:

- Right-click > **Add Watch**

---

### ✅ STEP 4: Check Returned Society Records

Once the debugger hits this:

```csharp
using (SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
```

💡 Put a **breakpoint inside the `while(reader.Read())` loop**, like here:

```csharp
while (reader.Read()) // Put breakpoint here
```

Then, step through (`F10`) and check the values:

```csharp
societies.Add(new Society
{
    Id = reader.GetInt32(0),
    SocietyName = reader.GetString(1),  // ← Watch this
    SocietyCode = reader.GetString(2)  // ← Watch this
});
```

---

## 🧪 4. **Check the SQL Parameter in Debug**

Click on `cmd.Parameters` in Watch or hover:

- Is `@CCode = 2` really being passed to SQL?
- Is your SQL query really using that parameter?

---

## 🐞 5. **Bonus: Set a Conditional Breakpoint**

If you want to **pause only when CCode is not 2**, do this:

1. Right-click the breakpoint (red dot)
2. Choose **"Conditions..."**
3. Type:

   ```
   CCode != 2
   ```

4. Now the app will **pause only if `CCode` is wrong**

---

## 🧹 6. **Potential Fix if Session CCode is Incorrect**

If you found `CCode` is `null` or incorrect:

```csharp
string? centerCode = HttpContext.Session.GetString("centerCode");
int? CCode = HttpContext.Session.GetInt32("CCode");
```

✅ Add a **tracepoint or a conditional breakpoint** to check if session is loading correctly

Also, make sure:

- You're setting session data **after login**
- Session is enabled in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` (`services.AddSession()` etc.)

---

## 🧾 7. **Final Suggestion: Print `CCode` as TempData for Fast Debug**

Temporarily add:

```csharp
TempData["DebugCCode"] = CCode;
```

Then display it in your view:

```html
<p style="color:red;">Debug CCode: @TempData["DebugCCode"]</p>
```

This helps even **without breaking**.

## 🎓 Summary

### ✅ What You Learned:

| Skill                     | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Regular Breakpoint (`F9`) | Pause to check variable flow          |
| Conditional Breakpoint    | Pause **only** on specific condition  |
| Watch & Hover             | See what variables hold at runtime    |
| Step Over (`F10`)         | Go line by line and see what executes |
| Tracepoint                | Print messages without stopping       |

---

## ❓What To Do Next?

Once you've verified `CCode` and SQL return values:

- If `CCode` is wrong → fix session issue
- If `CCode` is 2, but still extra data → problem might be **in SQL**, maybe old test data or bad joins (try querying DB again directly)
