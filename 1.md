### 🧭 Beginner’s Guide to the **“Add Application”** Window in IIS (Internet Information Services)

You're on the right track! The **"Add Application"** window in IIS is used to **host and configure a web application** under an existing website on your Windows server.

This guide will explain **each part of the window** and what you should fill in or check, in simple terms.

---

### ✅ What is the **"Add Application"** window for?

It lets you:

* Add a new web **application** (like your ASP.NET app) to a **website** that's already set up in IIS.
* Link the application to a **folder** on your server where your web files (like `.dll`, `.aspx`, `.cshtml`) are stored.
* Assign an **Application Pool** (which runs the app with certain settings and permissions).

### 📌 Fields in the "Add Application" Window

| Field                | What it Means                                              | What You Should Do                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site name**        | The website where you are adding your app.                 | Leave it as it is — in your case: `dev.renukagroup.com`                                                                    |
| **Path**             | The sub-path (also called "virtual path") of your app.     | `/milkapp` means the app will be accessed at `dev.renukagroup.com/milkapp`                                                 |
| **Alias**            | A short name used in IIS Manager for this app.             | Usually same as the last part of the path, e.g., `milkapp`                                                                 |
| **Application pool** | Controls how your app runs (e.g., .NET version, identity). | You can leave this as `dev.renukagroup.com` unless told otherwise                                                          |
| **Physical path**    | The actual folder location of your app on the server.      | This must be correct: `D:\inhousa\milkapp` → make sure the **folder exists** and has the correct files (like `web.config`) |

### 🔐 Authentication Section

| Option                          | Meaning                                                      | What You Should Do                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pass-through authentication** | Uses the same identity as the app pool to access the folder. | Keep this **selected** (default is fine for most cases)                      |
| **Connect as…**                 | Optional: set a specific Windows user to access the folder.  | Leave it unless you get a permissions error                                  |
| **Test Settings…**              | Verifies if IIS can access the folder.                       | Click this after filling the form — it will help you avoid permission issues |

### ⚙️ Management Options

| Option             | Meaning                                                                        | What You Should Do                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable Preload** | Lets the app start automatically when IIS starts (good for faster first load). | Check this **only if your app needs to be always ready** (optional) |

---

### 🟢 Bottom Buttons

* **OK** → Click this to save and apply your new application.
* **Cancel** → Use this to cancel if you are unsure.

---

### 📌 After You Click "OK"

You should:

1. See `milkapp` listed under `dev.renukagroup.com` in the left pane.
2. Click **"Browse Application"** to test it in the browser.
3. If it doesn't load, go back and:

   * Check `web.config` errors
   * Check app pool settings (especially .NET version)
   * Check file/folder permissions (`IIS_IUSRS` should have read/execute access)

---

### ✅ Safety Tips for First-Timers

* 🛑 Don’t change Application Pool settings unless you know why.
* 📁 Make sure your app folder (`D:\inhousa\milkapp`) is fully copied and includes `web.config`.
* 🔐 If the app doesn't work, first test file/folder permissions and use "Test Settings…".
* 📝 Document every change you make — useful for rollback if needed.
